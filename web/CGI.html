          <p class="lead">Static websites don't deal with storing data in a database, they do not change based on users. In the beginning, all websites were static this all changed in 1993 when the National Center for Supercomputing Applications wrote the Common Gateway Interface standard protocol allowing command-line executables to be called that the time of the request. At the time Perl was the language of choice, Perl invented by Larry Wall in 1987 was a general use Unix scripting language. Early developers now armed with CGI put Perl to use making the first dynamic websites, Perl was favored because of its incredible regex and string parsing abilities. Side Note: Perl is still incredible for regex and string parsing today. From these early dynamic websites, the modern web was born many new server side languages began to gain popularity; python, PHP, asp, cold fusion, Java, and ASP.NET. Today some of these early languages have dropped off and many new ones have cropped up, but the goal is still the same to deliver more relevant content for many developers, it's been a dream to deliver a desktop software experience through the web. When you look at many of the dynamic sites today you will notice the trend of more and more application like data-driven websites, with live interaction between the interface and the users.</p>
